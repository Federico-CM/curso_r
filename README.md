# Data Analysis Exercises in R  
**Course materials for the Posgrado en Investigaciones Biomédicas (UNAM)**

## Overview

This repository contains **curated R exercises** developed for a graduate-level course taught at the *Posgrado en Investigaciones Biomédicas, UNAM*.  
The materials are designed to help students **build a strong conceptual and practical foundation in data analysis using R**, with a particular emphasis on:

- Understanding how R functions and objects work
- Developing effective data wrangling skills
- Identifying, diagnosing, and fixing errors
- Learning to reason through problems rather than memorizing solutions

The exercises were developed and refined over **two academic years**, based on classroom experience and student feedback.

## Topics Covered

While specific content may vary by exercise set, the repository broadly covers:

- R objects and data structures
- Functions and function arguments
- Data manipulation and transformation
- Common sources of errors in R and how to resolve them
- Reproducible analysis practices
- Exploratory workflows used in real data analysis tasks

## Pedagogical Approach

The exercises follow a **progressive learning structure**:

- Concepts are introduced incrementally
- Each exercise builds on previous examples
- Solutions can be inferred logically from earlier material
- Students are encouraged to explore, experiment, and debug
